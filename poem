Tick-tock, tick-tock, the clock’s nearly there,
The dreaded deadline hangs in the air.
By 23:59, the work must be done—
The last stretch awaits, the race has begun.

Two paths lie ahead in this twilight hour:
One to the desk, to harness mind's power,
To scramble and type till the screen turns dim,
Eyes heavy, hopes fading, the chances grow slim.

Or leave it as is, a draft sent in haste,
Abandon perfection, ignore every waste.
To slip out the door, to laughter and light,
To join friends and breathe in the cool, crisp night.

Choices weigh heavy, just moments to choose—
Rush through the task, or risk what you’ll lose.
But in this calm pause, the question feels right:
What’s worth the most in the hour before midnight?
